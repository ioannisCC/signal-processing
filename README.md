# signals-and-systems-matlab-project

A project which was made as part of a university assignment (in greek). The assignment includes signal manipulation and transformation as well as some implementations. Finally, I created Mozart's 41th symphony 'Jupiter' with signals and I reconsructed a 2D image with Discrete Fourier Transform.
